    Implementation of Faster R-CNN.

    The input to the model is expected to be a list of tensors, each of shape [C, H, W], one for each
    image, and should be in 0-1 range. Different images can have different sizes.

    The behavior of the model changes depending if it is in training or inference mode.

    During training, the model expects both the input tensors, as well as a targets (list of dictionary),
    containing:
        - boxes (FloatTensor[N, 4]): the ground-truth boxes in [x1, y1, x2, y2] format, with values
          between 0 and H and 0 and W
        - labels (Int64Tensor[N]): the class label for each ground-truth box

    The model returns a Dict[Tensor] during training, containing the classification and regression
    losses for both the RPN and the R-CNN.

    During inference, the model requires only the input tensors, and returns the post-processed
    predictions as a List[Dict[Tensor]], one for each input image. The fields of the Dict are as
    follows:
        - boxes (FloatTensor[N, 4]): the predicted boxes in [x1, y1, x2, y2] format, with values between
          0 and H and 0 and W
        - labels (Int64Tensor[N]): the predicted labels for each image
        - scores (Tensor[N]): the scores or each prediction

    :param backbone: (nn.Module), the network used to compute the features for the model.
            It should contain a out_channels attribute, which indicates the number of output
            channels that each feature map has (and it should be the same for all feature maps).
            The backbone should return a single Tensor or and OrderedDict[Tensor].
    :param num_classes: (int), number of output classes of the model (including the background).
            If box_predictor is specified, num_classes should be None.
    :param min_size: (int), minimum size of the image to be rescaled before feeding it to the backbone
    :param max_size: (int), maximum size of the image to be rescaled before feeding it to the backbone
    :param image_mean: (Tuple[float, float, float]):, mean values used for input normalization.
            They are generally the mean values of the dataset on which the backbone has been trained
            on
    :param image_std: (Tuple[float, float, float]), std values used for input normalization.
            They are generally the std values of the dataset on which the backbone has been trained on
    :param rpn_anchor_generator: (AnchorGenerator), module that generates the anchors for a set of feature maps.
    :param rpn_head: (nn.Module),  module that computes the objectness and regression deltas from the RPN
    :param rpn_pre_nms_top_n_train:(int),  number of proposals to keep before applying NMS during training

    :param rpn_nms_thresh: (float), NMS threshold used for postprocessing the RPN proposals
    :param rpn_fg_iou_thresh:(float), minimum IoU between the anchor and the GT box so that they can be
            considered as positive during training of the RPN.
    :param rpn_bg_iou_thresh:(float), maximum IoU between the anchor and the GT box so that they can be
            considered as negative during training of the RPN.

            for computing the loss

            of the RPN
